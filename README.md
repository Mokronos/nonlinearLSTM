# nonlinearLSTM
Trying to train LSTMs for non-linear models.
## Create data from classic models
- create nonlinear state space models
- add measuring noise at output to simulate real world data aquisition
- create training and test datasets
## Create LSTM
- create train/test functions and data pipeline
- create simple LSTM with pytorch
- visualize results
## Expand
- expand to more variations of classic models
- different activation functions (changes non-linearity)
- change datasets to better reflect real world (distributions of inputs)
